# üî¨ Scientific Calculator (No Libraries Edition)

Welcome to the **Scientific Calculator Challenge** ‚Äì a project designed for **intermediate software engineering students** working in **pairs** with **5-minute rotations**.

This is a console-based calculator where all mathematical functions must be **implemented from scratch**. That means no importing `math`, `numpy`, or similar libraries. Your calculator will do everything from the ground up.

---

## üéØ Objectives

- Implement a powerful scientific calculator with no external libraries.
- Reinforce understanding of:
  - Arithmetic operations
  - Trigonometry, exponents, and logarithms
  - Parsing and evaluating expressions
  - Memory storage and user-defined functions
- Practice clean coding, version control, and **pair programming**.

---

## üë• Pair Programming Rules

- Use **5-minute driver/navigator rotations**.
- Switch roles consistently.
- Driver types; navigator guides, asks questions, and suggests improvements.
- Use meaningful commits after each session.

=> 36

> f(x) = x^3 - x
> f(3)
=> 24

> undo
=> Undid last step

> store
=> Value stored in memory

> recall
=> 24
